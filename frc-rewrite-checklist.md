# FRACTURED CODE: EXHAUSTIVE REWRITE CHECKLIST & BENCHMARK SUITE

---

## I. CANON & WORLD CONSISTENCY

### 1. Technology & Science
- [ ] All references to Link, Cascade, Network, and digital consciousness are 100% compliant with the Series Bible & World Canon Reference.
- [ ] Technology functions, limitations, and physical/sensory effects are explicitly dramatized in-scene (not just explained). Example: Link extraction always causes trauma and is described with sensory immediacy.
- [ ] Cascade sensitivity is always layered: empathic resonance → energy field perception → harmonic manipulation → reality interface. Each stage must have escalating, unique sensory/behavioral cues.
- [ ] Digital consciousness (e.g. Mileo): show risk (fragmentation), advantage (expanded perception), and limitation (infrastructure dependency) in action and dialogue, not info-dump.
- [ ] All scientific/technical jargon is visually and emotionally grounded. No unexplained tech; every device/action has a consequence.

### 2. Political, Social, and Faction Logic
- [ ] Neo-Citania’s structure (districts, zones, borders) is always consistent; show how politics and crisis reshape society on the ground.
- [ ] Alliance and Resistance logic: every action, dialogue, and policy must follow canon motivation and historical precedent. No “villain logic”—even antagonists must have reasoned, canon-faithful motivations.
- [ ] All faction slang, rituals, and ideology are distinct and consistent; any social/cultural tension is dramatized, not just stated.

### 3. Timeline & Memory
- [ ] Every historical reference (Architect fall, NeuroSys, Gardener events) matches the Series Bible timeline.
- [ ] Flashbacks, trauma, and memory scenes must serve both present character arc and broader historical logic; no contradiction or “floating” memory.

### 4. Cultural & Linguistic Cohesion
- [ ] Dialogue, slang, and ritual are unique to each culture/faction; no generic or misplaced language.
- [ ] All philosophy, social debate, or ritual is rooted in world logic—e.g., authenticity vs. optimization, memory vs. forgetting.

## II. LITERARY & PROSE EXCELLENCE

### 1. Prose Rhythm, Style, and Texture
- [ ] Each sentence is intentional: rhythm, musicality, and clarity are prioritized.
- [ ] Triplet and parallel structure used for escalation, not redundancy; every repetition must add new meaning or tension.
- [ ] Filler, generic, or “AI” phrasing is strictly forbidden; flag and revise any passive, vague, or non-specific line.
- [ ] Metaphor, simile, and motif are deployed with purpose—always echoing fracture, resonance, evolution, or other core themes.

### 2. Sensory Immersion & Physicality
- [ ] Every major beat includes at least three sensory cues (sight, sound, touch, taste, kinesthetic, temperature, pressure, etc.).
- [ ] Environmental details are not “set dressing”—each one must impact mood, conflict, or character response (e.g., indigo light as threat or comfort).
- [ ] Emotional states are mapped onto the body: show anxiety, dread, euphoria, and trauma through physical response (sweat, muscle tension, blood, cold, etc.).
- [ ] Use of bioluminescence, quantum hum, taste of copper, etc., is not generic but unique to context and character POV.

### 3. Dialogue & Voice
- [ ] Every character’s speech reflects unique worldview, history, and psychological state.
- [ ] Dialogue never “on the nose”—subtext, history, and latent tension must permeate all conversations.
- [ ] Exposition is always embedded in action, conflict, or emotional stakes; never pure “as you know” info-dump.

### 4. Interiority & Character POV
- [ ] Each POV has a distinct, evolving voice—no interchangeable narration.
- [ ] Internal monologue is rich, dynamic, and closely tied to scene stakes.
- [ ] Show, don’t tell: every key emotion or philosophical conflict is dramatized through decision, sensory experience, or action.

## III. PLOT, STRUCTURE, AND ARC BENCHMARKS

### 1. Scene Functionality & Causal Logic
- [ ] Every scene escalates stakes, reveals character, deepens theme, or advances plot; no static or bridge scenes.
- [ ] All events are causally linked; no random or convenience-driven action.
- [ ] Each chapter has a clear arc: strong opening, escalation, and closure/hook.

### 2. Character Arcs & Relationship Dynamics
- [ ] All major characters change in quantifiable ways by act and book’s end (growth, regression, reversal).
- [ ] Interiority drives action—characters do, not just witness.
- [ ] Relationships must evolve, fracture, or heal in response to plot and theme.

### 3. Thematic Cohesion
- [ ] Each scene and chapter echoes at least one core theme (choice vs. control, memory, identity, transcendence).
- [ ] Thematic stakes are embodied in character decisions and consequences, not just discussed.

### 4. Structure & Pacing
- [ ] Openings hook with immediate character crisis, world in motion, and a sensory/philosophical question.
- [ ] Act breaks deliver reversal, escalation, or revelation; never meander or stall.
- [ ] Endings resolve major arcs, answer central philosophical questions, and position for next book if applicable.

## IV. EMOTIONAL, PHILOSOPHICAL, & MARKET IMPACT

### 1. Emotional Resonance
- [ ] Every chapter contains at least one moment of genuine loss, awe, dread, longing, or catharsis—evoked, not told.
- [ ] Heartbreak or hope must be shown through action, environment, or character behavior.

### 2. Philosophical Depth
- [ ] All speculative concepts (consciousness, memory, evolution) are dramatized through character struggle and world stakes.
- [ ] Characters embody the consequences of philosophical choices; “idea” scenes must also be emotionally charged.

### 3. Market & Genre Hooks
- [ ] Compare every act/chapter opening to benchmark novels (Blindsight, Ancillary Justice, Nexus, Quantum Thief, Snow Crash) for ambition, accessibility, and clarity.
- [ ] Pacing: blend meditative and kinetic scenes for both reflection and propulsion.
- [ ] Every act/arc delivers setpieces, reversals, or hooks that would “pop” in a pitch or back cover.

## V. QUALITY ASSURANCE & FINAL POLISH

### 1. Canon Audit
- [ ] Every term, tech, and historical reference is cross-checked against Series Bible.
- [ ] Any canon drift triggers immediate flag and correction.

### 2. Line-by-Line Review
- [ ] Each sentence is examined for rhythm, clarity, arc closure, and sensory richness.
- [ ] Any lingering generic, AI, or redundant phrasing is reworked or deleted.

### 3. Formatting & Submission Readiness
- [ ] Scene/POV tags, punctuation, and formatting match the Final Formatting & Style Guide.
- [ ] Output is clean, ready-to-submit Markdown; no extraneous notes or commentary.

### 4. Documentation & Creative Expansion
- [ ] All major changes are annotated (inline or log) with rationale (reference to market, literary, or canon standards).
- [ ] Optional: list creative expansions or deepening opportunities for each chapter, referencing Creative Expansion Ideas file.

## VI. CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER SECTIONAL CHECKLIST

For each chapter:
1. Review and integrate all actionable items from editorial review.
2. Cross-check against **Master Review Plan**: style, canon, theme, world, character.
3. Reference all benchmarks (Style, Sensory, Plot, Character, Market).
4. For each change, explain how it serves intellectual depth, emotional resonance, and market impact.
5. Resolve any ambiguity by deferring to Series Bible and Master Review Plan; if unclear, flag for clarification.
6. Prioritize: high-impact revisions first (prose, sensory, arc, plot), then polish (word choice, dialogue, sensory layering).
7. Final QA: line-by-line, cross-domain, and market-check for rhythm, closure, and readiness.

## VII. SUBMISSION-LEVEL FINAL TEST

**Before output, answer YES to all:**
- [ ] Would this chapter/section impress a top agent/publisher on first read?
- [ ] Does it stand alongside the best of its genre in prose, plot, character, world, and theme?
- [ ] Is it immersive, emotionally moving, and intellectually sophisticated?
- [ ] Is it canon-faithful and market-calibrated?
- [ ] Is every word necessary, every beat earned, every arc closed or escalated?
If ANY answer is NO, revise again.
