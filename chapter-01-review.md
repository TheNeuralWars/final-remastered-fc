## Actionable Revision List

1. **Canon Consistency**
   - [ ] Cross-check all terminology, tech, and world details with Series Bible.
   - [ ] Ensure timeline events and character backstory are aligned with canon.

2. **Prose & Sensory Immersion**
   - [ ] Rewrite opening paragraphs for maximum sensory and emotional hook.
   - [ ] Add physical/sensory detail to all major beats; minimum three senses per scene.
   - [ ] Replace any generic/AI phrasing with vivid, distinctive language.
   - [ ] Calibrate triplet/prose rhythm for impact, not redundancy.

3. **Character & Voice**
   - [ ] Sharpen POV character’s interiority—what are they feeling, dreading, hoping?
   - [ ] Distinctive voice—ensure all dialogue and narration reflect unique worldview.
   - [ ] Escalate any passive/confused moments into active choices or reactions.

4. **Plot & Thematic Clarity**
   - [ ] Ensure each scene escalates stakes or reveals critical world/character info.
   - [ ] Explicitly dramatize the core thematic tension (e.g., choice vs. control, memory vs. forgetting).
   - [ ] Strengthen the chapter’s arc—clear beginning, escalation, and (if partial) hook/closure.

5. **Worldbuilding Integration**
   - [ ] Make tech, politics, and environment consequential—every world detail should shape conflict or emotion.
   - [ ] If introducing new elements, tie them to Series Bible logic and show their impact.

6. **Market & Genre Standards**
   - [ ] Compare opening to genre comps—Blindsight, Ancillary Justice, Nexus, Quantum Thief, Snow Crash—for ambition, hook, and clarity.
   - [ ] Ensure pacing is tight and stakes are clear from page one.
